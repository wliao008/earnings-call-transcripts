<p>Christopher Danely – Citigroup</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Next up, we're very pleased to have Qualcomm, one of the largest and most profitable, most successful semiconductor companies ever. It’s our pleasure to have Steve Mollenkopf, the CEO. You all know Qualcomm is a company that's long dominated the handset space, through their excellent use of technology, but they've also been able to push into the automotive space, the data center space. They're in the process of making what we believe is a very bold acquisition of NXP to further inroads into the industrial and the automotive space, so we'll touch on that. And then I would be remised if we also didn't talk about the legal steel cage match with Apple.</p>
<p>So first off let’s talk 5G, Steve. The whole Citi tech team recently put out a big report on 5G listing you as one of the big beneficiaries. But unfortunately, since no one listens to me or reads my research, I'm going to leave it up to you to talk about how well positioned Qualcomm is in 5G, and we'll go from there.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Sure, so, 5G is – it’s the next big step in cellular. I think it's interesting for two reasons. One is it's another generation of cellular technology. You essentially get higher speeds. You get advanced robustness, and so you're setting up the business for the massive Internet of. You also get a number of features that make services that are very difficult to big mission-critical services essentially.</p>
<p>So there's a lot of that technology that goes into just the cellular side of it, but that's the first piece, another generation of cellular technology. But the more interesting part I think is that this is the case, this is the time, and this is when cellular road map really starts to be absorbed by other industries beside cellular. So automotive, things like self-driving cars, the network that will be used for self-driving cars has a different set of circumstances and requirements than what you would have in just the case of just pure cellular, and that is replicated across a number of different verticals, healthcare, the industrial space.</p>
<p>And what we're seeing is that in the preparations for 5G, which are accelerating, we're seeing just a bigger pipeline, a bigger funnel of industries that want to come talk to us, which is great. That's sort of environmentally what's going. For Qualcomm, it's a very good thing. We always do well in these transitions. We think we're in a leadership position. We have been assembling assets, things like the RF front-end that we're doing, the RF business. We want to be able to abstract all the complication of 5G for all these new industries that are not prepared to deal with cellular.</p>
<p>So it's a great opportunity for us and it’s one of the reasons why we’re doing the acquisition of NXP is to put us in a position from technology to market to go-to market to really take advantage of that.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, a little known fact is that the Qualcomm has been very successful in two other acquisitions in the RF and wireless LAN space and gaining share in the cellphone industry. When do you think 5G commercial devices? When will we see these first in the market.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>You’ll start to see the first commercial devices in 2019. You can go to the store, buy a device with 5G in it in 2019. You're already seeing people doing trials and early developments in the marketplace now. But the real standard compliance, new radio 5G will happen in 2019 time frame and we've been accelerating our plans for that.</p>
<p>If I were to answer that same question a year ago, I would have said 2020, and it's being pulled in part in The United States also in Asia. Interestingly, it's not – this is the first time I've seen this happen with the G transitions, but I've been in a number of G transitions. This is the first time that China is not waiting, and they're really wanting to go pretty aggressively as well.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p>So it's set up I think to be a pretty good time frame. The standard will get nailed down here in the second half of this year and into next year. You'll start to see our licensing rates come out, so there's is going to be a lot of activity consistent with that timeline happening here over the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>And why do think it’s being pulled in? Is it because it's going to touch so many more devices, and you have a lot of other interested parties in making this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well, there are two things, I think. One is that it's just undeniable, the delivery of video over wireless, and I would say, the convergence of how do I deliver something in the home to how do I deliver it in the macro area and then how do I have this service continuity at very, very high data rates, very, very high capacity levels in the network, how we do that. So that's sort of I want to deliver video everywhere to anything. That's happening, number one.</p>
<p>The second thing is almost geopolitical, which is I think industries, industry players like us but also industry players in China realize that this transition to the cellular industry is going to be used in all these new – a lot of different industries. It's the disruptive force being connected to the Internet is the disruptive force that's happening to a lot of industries, so the industrial Internet, for example.</p>
<p>So I think, countries are saying, this is going to be so important to my industrial policy. I don't want to be late and so I want to pull that forward, not only from a service delivery point of view but for technology companies. So a lot of momentum for this G transition.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Definitely, I guess, take a step back maybe take us through how you did in 4G? And do you feel like you’re even better positioned in 5G? And what are the challenges for you positioning-wise in 5G?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>I see the 5G transition being similar to what we did in 4G. 4G was a very good transition for us. I think a lot people thought Qualcomm wouldn't be successful in 4G. That was the time when we were transitioning from being known so much for our CDMA expertise and – but would we be successful in OFDMA. Would we have the scale? And obviously, we did very well both in the chip business as well as in the licensing business. We think it's a similar transition occurring on 5G.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is just like in the 4G transition, I don't think you're going to be a strong 5G player unless you were already a strong 4G and 3G player. And that has to do with the way in which the network will be deployed. It will be deployed with regional hotspots of 5G where maybe they have spectrum allocations, very favorable. They have millimeter-wave frequencies depending on the geography or the location, and it will be on top of a sea of 4G.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p>And the difficulty for people, and it's something that we're quite good at I think, is how do I get a solution that works in an environment I walk in and out of those regions. So we have – multi mode's very, very important. The ability to deliver 4G along with 5G is very, very important and all the RF expertise. And what's going to happen is that the operators will say I can only deploy 5G in these hotspots, but I want to increase my 4G network capability. And that’s what’s driving things like gigabit LTE that you're seeing – a press release on that this morning. So the whole idea is how do I get service continuity as best I can across the different regions? And so I think you're starting to already see them prepare the networks for that transition.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Actually, if you could maybe spend a little bit on how QCT is positioned in Gigabit LTE for the crowd here?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well I think we are well positioned. If you look, we're probably uniquely positioned in the sense that we have the leading road map for feature set. We have a broader tier of products, which is always very important in the semiconductor space, which means that we can sell in different price points and we can make it easy for customers to start at a particular price point and grow their business. We have geographical scale. You should read that as we've already figured out how to do business in China, and we're helping the Chinese industry become international players at the same time that we're doing the same thing in the United States.</p>
<p>So we have international scale. But we also I think have expertise in marrying the very difficult RF capability. So if you look at 5G, there's just tremendous amount of RF capability that's required and the ability to design a system that goes all the way to the antenna to the baseband enables you to abstract that very, very challenging RF environment. We're, I think we're one of the few companies, probably the only company, that has all of that expertise in-house and the scale to deliver that to multiple industries.</p>
<p>So we feel like we've got the right basket of goods it couldn’t happen fast enough.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>We have seen some speculation that 5G might, the roll out might be a lot faster than 4G. Would you share that?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>I think 4G was very good timing because it came at the time when people wanted to transition to the computer in your pocket. So you had a combination of low-power computing in a semiconductor device that can go into your pocket, at the same time that you could have high-speed and low cost per bit delivery wirelessly. So you had this – it's the first time that you had both of those things kind of traveling together as a pair.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p>Now Qualcomm, we deliver that in one device, that's the Snapdragon device. That's what happened in 4G and so we had this very rapid ramp. And the debate was always, will – or to go to question today is sort of will 5G ramp like 4G did, which is very quickly? Or will it ramp like 3G did, which was we don't know exactly what we're going to use it for in Europe and it kind of rode – it went slowly until the smartphone kind of came along. I think 5G is going to look more like 4G, and the drivers are the same things that are driving 4G.</p>
<p>But also you're seeing companies use 5G and due to the spectrum allocation or the advances in technology and the standard itself to grow their business model. So you're seeing in North America. You're seeing wireless operators preparing to deliver a service that previously can only be delivered by wireline operators, for example or cable company. And you are seeing the cable companies say I need to make sure I have a wireless strategy. How do I position it here. Now at Qualcomm, what we try to do is create the fundamental technology at scale so that those disruptions can occur in those industries. So called we try to light the fuse by creating the technology underneath, and it's set up well.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>So segue to my next question is the automotive end-market you guys were making a big push into – in a number of different ways, maybe talk about how QCT is positioned in automotive end market, we will get to NXP in a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>So QCT, which is our semiconductor business, has been successful in the automobile space for some time. The original success, and continues to be an area of success, is selling connectivity, basically cellular connectivity into the telematics piece of the car. Good business for us. We’ve shipped hundreds of millions of chipsets. It continues to be a good business for us. All of the things I mentioned about kind of technology at scale and leadership road map, all are favored in the automobile space as well as just quality delivery is very important. I mean, people don't want to have to recall a car because of the telematics unit so</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Recalls are generally not good.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>So the quality premium is appreciated in the automobile space. Now we've been growing our business in two areas recently and seeing success. One is in the infotainment area. So essentially, what we did was we took our computing success, so our application processor assets from the handset space. And we've transitioned that over into the automobile space, and we're getting wins in the infotainment area, which we're very pleased about.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p>You'll start to see even more those come out here over the next couple of years, but the design pipeline and we're quite pleased with. And the reason is the traditional semiconductor suppliers into the automobile space tend not to have the low-power high-performance computing.</p>
<p>So they don't have the CPU or the GPU assets to be competitive, and that's why you tend to see some of the cellular guys doing well there. So that's working. We also did an acquisition of CSR a little while ago, and that's actually helped us in the audio and Bluetooth space in the car. And so we built a set of assets with connectivity and I would say high-performance low-power computing to set up into this transition.</p>
<p>Now where the car is going, we think, is quite advantageous for someone coming in with our set of core competencies, which is the – what's happening in the car is there's this big change of architecture in the car. And there's a lot of people who have thrown their hat into the ring about, Hey, I want to control how the car is going to be architected.</p>
<p>And what Qualcomm is doing is essentially saying, I want to get all the pieces that allow me to be a good partner to whomever wins that debate. And so we bring in the connectivity and the low-power computing. I'm sure you'll ask, NXP brings in a lot of the other car pieces, a tremendous portfolio from Ethernet, secure Ethernet to all of the, just the tremendous set of assets.</p>
<p>Incidentally, they don't have the set of assets that we bring. And so we think we'll be uniquely positioned in almost every subsystem in the car at the time when this architecture debate occurs, and so we're quite pleased with that. You'll see more from us once the deal closes on that.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You guys are actually – it's kind of funny you're buying one of your potentially biggest partners in the automotive space. Who do you see as your main competitor in terms of supply in all these products to the automotive manufacturers?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>I don't think – I think, well, first of all, it's an incredibly competitive and interesting space. I mean, there are a lot of people who want to get into the car. We, I think, we're uniquely positioned in the connectivity and the computing piece.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>You have by far the biggest suite, I guess, of semiconductors there.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Now post NXP, I think we're going to be in a very, very strong position in the car space. And then what we will do is add in, I would, say the algorithmic aspect of what you need to do for the self-driving car. And our goal is really how do you become the best partner to all the people that want to go into the car. And with the car becoming electrified, the number of different types of companies that are going to go into the car space or to the vehicle space, because the car itself will change, will grow. And we think that's a great opportunity for us.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p>In terms of competitors, I mean, obviously Intel is a competitor. I think Nvidia, for certain aspects of it, is a competitor. But I think we feel we have a very strong set of assets to compete.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>By far. Another area that you guys are getting some success in is the data center. Partnered with another company I follow, Xilinx. Maybe talk about what the data center means to Qualcomm? Focus there, your advantages you have, and how's that working out.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Sure. So the data center is an interesting space for us because it's going through a transition. And the transition, I think, there are at least three aspects of it that I would highlight. One, is the growth is happening in data centers that people are architecting and building themselves, meaning that these are the big cloud providers. They are building their own cloud areas, or they are offering cloud services broadly. And they want to have control over the architecture of the data center, and they want a willing partner that has scale and someone instead of just their normal option. And so that's an opportunity for us, particularly in the developing world and particularly on the West Coast of the United States. We have that.</p>
<p>The second one is that you're seeing the advent or the growth of the Chinese cloud. So China wants to have its own cloud, and we're leveraging a joint venture in China that’s Guizhou to participate in the growth of that cloud. So as a new participant in the data center space, we want to figure out how do we build scale and get some of these big trends, get on the front-end of these big transitions, so we're doing that.</p>
<p>And then the second – the third one, the final one is that this is probably the first time in the history of semiconductors where transistor leadership is not occurring in the PC space first. So we're seeing through Samsung and TSMC particularly extremely competitive just raw transistor capability, which we think enables us to compete not only in the handset space, but we can leverage that investment to see it – a real disruption, we think, competitive disruption, in the data center space.</p>
<p>That all being said, it's early days. We're pleased with the customer traction that we're getting, but we're trying to be very, I think, prudent in how we talk about it to the Street, which is, it's going to take a while for us to learn how to be successful in this space. Same thing happened to us on – in the computing part of smartphones. Everyone would say, okay, we had to build a couple of generations to really learn how to do it.</p>
<p>Now we think we're world's best, but same thing will happen in the data center space, really learning about how – what those workloads are and how to optimize that. And we're in that phase right now.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>You think ultimately it could be close to the size of the automotive opportunity? Or is the automotive opportunity just dwarfing where the things can go in the data center?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Data center opportunity is actually quite large if you're successful. The issue that I think everyone talks to us about is not if it's a big opportunity, it's how successful will you be against the incumbent. And we have the benefit of hearing the desire from the customer base for us to be a winner there. And I think there won't be, in our opinion, scale is going to be important to winning that long-term, getting the right to be another player in there. Scale is going to be very important.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Right. So let's shift gears here a little bit, talk about NXP. I know you spent a lot of time on 5G talking about how it’s going to personally be driven by people who wanted to get the information into the automotive and the industrial space just like 4G was, we're moving to the sort of mobile phone-centric world. When you step back, was this part of sort of your long-term strategy? Hey, we want to be even better positioned in 5G, and we need to grab some other real estate? Or how does this sort of curb out?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well, it is. I mean, if you look – I'll just remind – so environmentally, what we're seeing in the marketplace is that the cellular road map is becoming relevant in a number of new industries. It ends up – some of those industries, Qualcomm coming out of the handset space is not positioned well enough to sell into those markets the way that we want to and as aggressively as we want to. So you can think of that as, we may or may not have the right technology to really be a big player in the auto space if we don't do an acquisition.</p>
<p>And then our ability to sell into those markets, the go to market is very different than the handset space. So the kind of industrial logic is, can we leverage the IP road map that we invest in at scale in the handset space and share that with a mature go-to-market organization that is looking for that exact IP road map at the time when the industry is now saying, boy, that road map is very relevant, and it wasn't before. So in the automobile space, we talked about – we get two other, I think, pretty interesting assets. The first one is the one that everybody kind of picks up on, which is our ability to sell into the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>They have 30,000 customers. They have a tremendous enablement capability that comes out of the MCU business that was both Freescale and NXP. And can we feed our Snapdragon technologies into that mature group? And can they really accelerate Qualcomm's ability to deliver that market? A lot of customers want us to do that, too. They're very happy about that. And the third one, the one that, I think, a lot of people don't spend as much time talking about but we think is quite interesting is the security side.</p>
<p>Security for us is, we think, a differentiator and an innovation vector that will be very important, just like graphics or video, or in our case, we have a number of machine learning assets. So we think that's an important component to have. And they have a lot of expertise in that area. And we think it's going to be a good technology to layer into the Qualcomm machine.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Great. I have a series of questions on that as far as a check-the-box question. When is it supposed to close? There's been some talk or speculation that there might be a new price involved or something like that. Can you comment on that?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think the real focus of the team is to get through regulatory. We're not seeing anything that we didn't expect in regulatory. We think it's on track. We'll close by the end of the year from what we see. We're obviously a large company. We have a unique business model that's not associated with the semiconductor business that I think grabs a lot of attention. So it's just – it's always a little bit – we always grab a little bit more attention in the regulator side than, I would say, just the normal small company going through there, but we're not seeing anything that's unusual going on.</p>
<p>So there are nine jurisdictions. I think we're closed in four or five. The real big ones that are pending are China and the EU. The EU is – we're in second phase. There's kind of a back and forth between stopping the clock. But ultimately, what's – we don't see anything there that we didn't expect, and we think it'll close by end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>What, as far as the EU goes, are they asking for anything else or anything more? Is this just normal?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Unusual, I mean, it's a large acquisition. It's a complicated set of assets. You have a lot of folks. But we're – we think – we haven't seen anything we didn't expect to see, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Sure. And it seems like China has not asked for anything more. That's smooth sailing so far.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I think that's accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>And has Korea passed or not?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Korea has not yet.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Got it. So that's the only that's left. Maybe talk about sort of Qualcomm plus NXP. Do you see any products that you might not necessarily want or there's something in there that might be divested?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>We haven't decided on that and also it's not something we can really talk about. We're not one company. But we – you should think of the portfolio as pretty complementary. And if you look – even from a technology perspective in the auto space, I mentioned how we kind of have what they need and vice versa. So it's very complementary actually. And we're seeing that even in customer response when people – we ask customers what do you think about it. Obviously, we don't have – we kind of can't have the kind of customer meetings we can have when we're closed, but customers are pretty excited about it. So all those things are, I think, the right – those – that's the right set of characteristics to get through regulatory and have a successful deal.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Yes. That was going to be my next question is what's been the customer reaction? What would they be most excited about? What do they mostly talk about?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>It's interesting. They're excited by the same thing that we're excited about, which is, you have a company that now has a complete set of assets to help them solve the problem because the problems for a lot of the companies that we would service, and I'll just use the automobile space, although that's not the only value driver of the deal, is that the car is just becoming incredibly complex from a semiconductor point of view. And if you can get a company that can make it easy for them, then you can – it helps them. So they think, you'll be a stronger partner. We know you both. That's great and looking forward to working together type of thing.</p>
<p>The other thing that you get is, you get some positive reaction on the financial strength of the supplier. So for example, a lot of people, particularly in the semiconductor space, have taken on debt in order to create the companies that they have. And so from an automobile point of view, which has a very, very long time line, you're supplying for extremely long time period, they actually do care about what the financial strength – what your balance sheet looks like is actually an issue when you're doing RFPs because they want to make sure that you're going to be around for a long time. And I think they view the combination as being quite strong from a financial perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Yes, so you've talked about how NXP helps your product portfolio. I think that's pretty obvious, a lot of synergies there. How does Qualcomm help NXP in terms of product portfolio and sale?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well, I mean, I'll give my own view, and I think Rick Clemmer, who made some comments actually when the deal was announced and basically said, hey, there's some assets that Qualcomm has in connectivity and computing that you'd have to figure out how you get that and get there. And I would just refer people to his comments. I don't want to put words in his mouth. But I think what's going to happen in the automobile space is that you're really going to need access to that cellular road map.</p>
<p>And the cellular road map, everyone thinks is connectivity, but it's actually low-power computing. And without that, I think it's quite difficult to meet the computing needs that are going to be required. So what's happening to the car is that these subsystems are sort of becoming more complex. The computing aspect is going up at the same time that it's being distributed throughout the car. And so – by the way, not a dissimilar technology trajectory to what we saw when the handset became a little minicomputer that's connected to your – to the Internet in your pocket, is that the key to being successful as a semiconductor industry was could you figure out a way to deliver multiple assets in a very easy way to customers?</p>
<p>So meaning, that's why the SoC component was such an important – the ability to do SoCs, multiple technologies at one time with a lot of software around it was very, very important – continues to be very, very important to winning in the handset space. That same transition is occurring in the – and will continue to occur in the automobile space.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Great. One last question before we shift gears to Apple as far as the whole activist. I mean, you've dealt with activists before. Do you have any thoughts? Can you give us anything on the thirst, the desire, the chance for a higher price? Or is it pretty much done, set, we're good and move on and?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think there's really nothing for us to say. Our focus, our job right now is to get through regulatory and get prepared for Day 1.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, I had to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>So Apple. What is up with these guys, man? I mean, what do you think – what is their goal? What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think it's sort of a – it's really a fight over contract really at the end of the day. And that's kind of the way we see it. And I think they want to pay less than we think the value that's been established on hundreds of agreements. So unfortunately, we have to kind of go through legal means in order to enforce that contract, and you're seeing that play out. And that process is not the normal process that we usually talk about products and things, but that's what's ongoing. So I think it's really kind of a fairly simple motivation, but clouded in a lot of complicated legal maneuvering to try to make sure that we can get what we need for our shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Yes. So I mean, do you think they're just trying to accomplish like a lower royalty rate? Or do they really want to reset the bar? And what do you think the chances are that this – I mean, you can't answer this, but that this actually goes to court versus some sort of settlement?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well, the history of this is – for us is that these things get settled out of court. Now the timing of that is never known. And there's always a lot of elements back and forth. I think people need to realize, there's always discussions and time is always moving forward and product road maps are moving. All the kind of normal things that cause business to occur are happening all the time. And the companies talk, and we know how to work together, and we have pretty important business together.</p>
<p>So it's not like we're on the other sides of the Earth, so which is one. But look, sometimes you have to go through the legal aspect in order to get the right value for both sides. My own view of what you're seeing is we have this long history of a successful and I think incredibly – we're very proud of our licensing business. We're proud of it because, essentially, it allows new entrants to come into cellular very easily. And you can just see the number of people that come in and out of that industry without ever having to do the fundamental IP to participate.</p>
<p>By the way, Apple is a great example of that. And the mechanism for that to occur is the contract we're fighting over right now. So we think the facts and the contract law, the way the industry is organized, the hundreds of agreements that we have are a very, very compelling argument that we're in the right side here. I think from their perspective, at least our view, is that they probably saw that the same way and said, well, we better try to put some pressure through regulatory means because the contract is – and the precedent is so obviously in Qualcomm's favor so.</p>
<p>And you're seeing, I think, both of those things play out. But we'll get through it like we've done many times before. Sometimes I've been quoted as saying this, but sometimes these things get settled on the courtroom steps and sometimes they don't. And we've seen those things happen. They're all different. All these experiences like this are always different.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you're taking it so calm. How do you think your – that's on the royalty side. How does this impact – or how do you think your QCT or your semiconductor relationship will trend with Apple over time?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think we probably already experienced a hit.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>A change?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And that's the way you should look at it. I do think, however, that having the strategic ground of having the best product at a time when the industry is moving, the – you got 5G coming. You've got Gigabit LTE coming. You've got just more and more complication happening on the cellular side. That's a good, strategic ground to hold while you're, number one, negotiating, but also after you resolve the license dispute, it's even easier to compete.</p>
<p>So the history of these things essentially is that you can resolve the licensing side and then you kind of get back to normal business. And we hope that that's the case here, but that's sort of what's happened in the past. Now our road map and what we think is happening in the industry sets up well for that, but it's really in many respects up to them.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Did you ever think of withholding product from them? Hey, you're withholding a stash, we'll withhold product.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>I would say we – I'll probably not answer that directly.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Mollenkopf</strong></p>
<p>But I would say we've really tried to separate the two issues. I mean, we – with the exception of me, there's really – they're very separate teams that deal with this. It's been like that in the company forever. We really want to keep these things separate. And we have a very important product business. We think being a good supplier is important. It's important business to us and the shareholders. And we try to have the least amount of disruption that we can have on that. Remember, we want to be a partner to people for decades, so it's – we take a long view.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Danely</strong></p>
<p>Great. I have a bunch more questions, but I'd be remiss if I didn't open it up to the audience in case anybody has any questions out there or else I'll keep going. Over here.</p>
<p id="question-answer-session"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q - Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>I guess you guys recently had a press release that you're shipping kind of 1 million IoT chips a day, which is, I guess, pretty small in the global scheme of things in terms of your revenues. With narrowband LTE rolling out, what are the enablers we should look for and what's the timing where this could actually be a more important business for you? How should we think about that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Mollenkopf</span></strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry. I couldn't hear the first part of your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry. Internet of Things, you were shipping 1 million IoT chips per day, which is not a huge part of your business today, but how should we think of that scaling with narrowband LTE?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Mollenkopf</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So if you look at our – first of all, if you look at our adjacent markets, so you should think of that as the noncellular part of our semiconductor business. It's actually been a pretty good business for us. It's about a $3 billion business if you take our data points and move it forward. It's growing much faster than the cellular side. I think it was about 10% of revenue a couple of years ago. And then it grew at 40% and then this year – last year. We think it grows at 25-plus percent this year, I think, is what we said. And the – and that's already a $3 billion business, has good margins. It's a good business for us. So it's already a significant business. It's a combination of a number of things.</p>
<p>Now narrowband IoT, which you asked about. I think it's not clear how big that market is going to be economically. It's going to be a lot of units. It's an important component of it. Our strategy on it is let's make a solution that can be used everywhere. So it has narrowband IoT plus all the other cellular standards so that you can ship one product into the entire supply chain for electronics and it can be used anywhere in the world, different strategy than some other people have, which would have kind of a point solution. That's starting to come out.</p>
<p>That'll be an interesting thing. I think you can almost see narrowband IoT as a feature within a broader IoT business that uses cellular and has maybe very high features in certain applications and low features in others. So it'll ramp up, and it'll be a component of that IoT strength that we talk about, but I don't know if it will be the dominant piece of it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Danely</span></strong></p>
<p>Anybody else out there? In the back.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Competitively, we've seen you continue to create a gap between Intel and MediaTek. Experts will cite the broad advantage on the technological architectures with your competitors being more DSP-based, and this is giving you advantage in multiband. I – kind of as we look into the 5G world, do you kind of see this gap widening and just kind of based on your other comments on multibit complexity?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Mollenkopf</span></strong></p>
<p>I feel like we're in a great position competitively for 5G. If you look at our set of assets, our ability to deliver, I feel good about 5G. I think – I didn't completely hear it. It's kind of the audio is a little bit hard to hear, but we do have – I think we probably have architectural flexibility that other people don't have because we have from DSP to custom logic to CPU to RF and filter capability and the RF transceiver, we have more, I think, end-to-end architectural flexibility than others. Now that's important when you're going into something like 5G, where you have very, very high data rates and tremendous amount of RF and antenna complexity that you have to marry to.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons that we put together the filter and the PA assets that we did was to get prepared for that transition. And if you look today, we actually already – you can see evidence of that. So if you look at the – some of the Galaxy devices, they have special antenna tuners that came from Qualcomm that allow the antenna to tune around your hand and you get better coverage. That will be very normal when you get to 5G because the – you're going to get these massive MIMO antenna placements. They're very small antennas because of the frequency, but there's a lot of them on the phone.</p>
<p>And your ability to move that antenna around essentially, electronically tune it and do a number of things by doing some things back in the baseband as well as out of the antenna, will enable that market to grow in ways that it wouldn't otherwise. And so we think we have a unique set of goods to be able to do that and a history of being able to deliver that to people who maybe wouldn't be able to do that themselves.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Danely</span></strong></p>
<p>We have time for one more question. And I'm sorry, since I'm hosting, I'm going to take it. We haven't talked about the market. So maybe just give us your sense on how the wireless trends are. Maybe just comment on – you guys have done a nice job gaining share over in China. Seems like your competitor might take a little bit of share over at Apple. Just kind of give us your sense of what's going on in handsets this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Mollenkopf</span></strong></p>
<p>It's been growing. I mean, if you look, I think that it continues to grow at the total market level. I think a lot of people wouldn't have thought that a little while ago. Within the handset space that we service in semiconductors, China continues to be a strong part for us. It's strong across three good elements, where we – share is good. The market is doing a good job. And the products that we're selling into are raising in price and they have better gross margins on a product-by-product basis than we used to sell before, and that's been helping our business.</p>
<p>The next phase for China, even before you get to 5G and all of that, is that the Chinese OEMs are looking – they have ambitions to be international players. And you're seeing the first example of that in India. You're seeing a little bit of that in Southeast Asia. And I think that trend will continue. And there's some strong OEMs there that, I think, your starting to get some recognition worldwide, hey, these could be significant handset players in the future. And so we're partnering with them, and that tends to be a good trend for us.</p>

<p>Great. Thanks, again, Steve.</p>
