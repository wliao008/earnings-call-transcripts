<p><strong>Colin Stretch</strong></p>
<p>Good morning. Good morning and welcome and thanks for joining us for Facebook’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders. I am Colin Stretch General Counsel of Facebook and Secretary of this annual meeting, which I now call to order. Let me run through today’s agenda. We will first focus on the formal business set forth in our proxy statement. Mark will then spend a few minutes talking about how Facebook is doing and then we will have a general Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>Before we begin with the formal business, I’d like to remind you to please turn off all mobile devices, and the list of rules of conduct for the annual meeting that you were all provided when you entered the room. To conduct an orderly meeting, we ask that participants abide by these rules, including the prohibition on recording audio or video. Thank you for your cooperation in advance.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p>Now, let me start by introducing the members of our Board of Directors who are here today; Mark Zuckerberg; Sheryl Sandberg; Erskine Bowles; and Sue Desmond-Hellmann. I would also like to introduce a few more people who are in attendance. Alex Bender of Ernst &amp; Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm is present. And also present is Kris Veaco, who has appointed by the Board to act as the Inspector of Election for this meeting, and will tabulate the results of the voting. Ms. Veaco has executed the oath of Inspector of Election.</p>
<p>Turning now to the formal business of the meeting I will first report on the notice of this meeting. I have a copy of the notice of the meeting, together with a declaration as to mailing and the proxy statement made available to all of Facebook stockholders of record to term into as of the close of business April 13, 2015. I have a list of the stockholders entitled to vote at this meeting, which is available for inspection by any stockholder present or by any proxy holder representing a stockholder, and which list will be filed with the records of this meeting. I am advised by the Inspector of Election, that the holders of shares representing at least a majority of the voting power of Facebook entitled to vote are present or represented by proxy here today, and a quorum is therefore present. This meeting is therefore authorized to transact business.</p>
<p>We have six proposals to consider at this meeting, each of which is described in the proxy statement. We will discuss these proposals momentarily. First, however I’ll remind you that the voting today is by proxy and written ballots. If you have already sent in a proxy and do not intend to change your vote, there is no need for you to cast a ballot today. Any stockholder present who have not returned the proxy or who wishes to change your vote should cast a vote here at this meeting. So if any stockholder wish to cast a ballot today that is not already done so, if you do, please raise your hand for a ballot and one of our volunteers will bring a ballot to you. And just keep your hand up until one of our volunteers get to you.</p>
<p>It’s now 11:03 and we will now open the polls for voting. You may vote at anytime during the ensuing discussion of the proposals on the agenda. To vote please mark and sign your ballot accordingly and then once you are done with voting, raise your hand again and one of our volunteers will come to you to collect your ballot, yes no rushes. Yes again, keep your hand up if you need a ballot.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p>So I will now review the proposals to be voted on by the stockholders at this meeting. And then we will take questions specifically on the proposals when I am completed with my summary. The first item of business is to elect our Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting or until the year of their death, resignation or removal. The director nominees are Marc Andreessen, Erskine Bowles, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Reed Hastings, Jan Koum, Sheryl Sandberg, Peter Thiel and Mark Zuckerberg. The qualifications of each proposed director is set forth in the proxy statement and no other director nominees have been properly submitted for election pursuant to our bylaws or SEC rules. Therefore no other nominations for the Board may be accepted.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors recommends a vote for the elect of each of the nominated directors. Proposal number two the second item of business is to ratify the appointment of Ernst &amp; Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2015. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for the ratification of the appointment of Ernst &amp; Young LLP. Proposal number three, the third of item of business is to reapprove the Section 162(m) limits of our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan under the Internal Revenue Code to preserve our ability to receive certain corporate income tax deductions that may become available to us in the future. The Board of Directors recommends vote for re-approval of such 162(m) limits.</p>
<p>Finally we have received three stockholder proposals that comply with the requirements of our bylaws and SEC rules and are therefore eligible to be voted on at this meeting. Proposal number four request of change in stockholder voting, proposal number five is a proposal regarding an Annual Sustainability Report and proposal number six is a proposal regarding a human rights risk assessments. With respect to these three stockholder proposals, the proposals themselves supporting statements and the Company's opposition statements are set forth in the proxy statement. The Board of Directors as reflected in the proxy statement recommends a vote against each of the stockholder proposals.</p>
<p>The applicable proponent of each of the stockholder proposals may now make a statement in support of their respective proposals. I will call you up one by one to the microphone. I would ask that you please limit your statement in support of your proposal to three minutes and once we've gone through all three of them, we'll have a short Q&amp;A section on the formal business of the meeting on these proposals that we're considering. So first with respect to proposal number four, Ms. Christine Jantz representing NorthStar Asset Management Funded Pension Plan. Ms. Jane, thank you.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p><strong>Christine Jantz</strong></p>
<p>Good morning. My name is Christine Jantz from NorthStar Asset Management in Boston, the beneficial owner of over $4 million of Facebook common stock. I am here to represent resolution number four, a good governance proposal which would get each share and equal vote and would allow representative shareholder votes. As shareholders know Facebook has two classes of stock, class A with 1 vote per share and class B with an overwhelming 10 votes per share which is closely held by management insiders.</p>
<p>This discrepancy gives the majority a super majority of control to insiders essentially making it impossible for stockholders to weigh in. Yet the concern we raise here is not just about fairness, we are also concerned that insiders and management seek to insulate the governance of the firm from shareholder oversight. Studies have shown that excessive voting controls given to insiders rather than enhancing performance leads to poor performance over the long run. In fact a study has reported that the more control that insiders have the more they can pursue strategies that are at the expense of outside shareholders.</p>
<p>In fact studies have shown that on the average and overtime companies with multiclass capital structures underperformed those with the one share, one vote standard in which owners' economic risk is commensurate with voting power. And as others point out, with new constraints placed upon them managers holding super class stock has been out of control. Families and senior managers can entrench themselves into the operations of the Company regardless of their abilities and performance.</p>
<p>Finally dual-class structures may allow management to make bad decisions with due consequences. Given that part of our Company's mission is to make the world more open, limiting substantial shareholder input is wildly counterintuitive. We feel that shareholder value is best derived when insider voting control of the firm is separated from insider economic ownership. Economic ownership provides enough of a reward for management and stock parts as rise.</p>
<p>The current dual-class structure eliminates shareholder checks and balances every management decisions. Without a tally of one vote per share claiming that stockholders rejected or accepted a proposal mainly little more than Mr. Zuckerberg has voted against it. We are very concerned that over the long-term the use of insider control of Facebook will inhibit shareholders from weighing in on company governance and policy issues with detrimental effects on shareholder value for the long-term. We urge you to vote for proxy item number four.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p><strong>Colin Stretch</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Ms. Jantz. Next with respect to proposal number five Sister Judy Byron who is representing today the Controller of the State of New York, Sister Byron thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Judy Byron</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Zuckerberg, shareholders, I am here today on behalf of the New York State Common Retirement Fund to introduce the funds’ resolution calling on Facebook to issue Annual Sustainability Report describing the Company's environmental, social and governance, policies and practices. Environmental, social and governance issues can pose significant risks to businesses and without proper disclosure shareholders and analysts cannot determine whether the Company is managing these risks properly. The majority of Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 companies already recognize the value of sustainability reporting by regularly issuing such reports. We believe that Facebook should join that number and therefore on behalf of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, holders of 6,097,642 Facebook shares, I submit the resolution on sustainability reporting found in your proxy materials. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Colin Stretch</strong></p>
<p>Now with respect to proposal number six again Sister Judy Byron now representing, the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary Sister Byron.</p>
<p><strong>Judy Byron</strong></p>
<p>Our commitment to children's life and welfare along with our fiduciary responsibility as investors motivated us to trial this proposal which seeks to ensure Facebook's protection of the human rights of its younger users. We were pleased to dialogue with our company's management in December but we’re disappointed that Facebook failed to answer multiple questions we raised. We remained unconvinced that the company is adequately addressing risks from possible children rights violation in its operations, and therefore did not withdraw the resolution which calls on the Board of Directors to report to shareholders on Facebook's process for identifying and analyzing potential and actual human rights risks of Facebook's operations.</p>
<p>How Facebook uses young people's data for commercial purposes and the kinds of marketing to which young people are subject on the platform are human rights issues. Children's right to privacy is memorialized in the UN convention on the rights for the child, and the benefits and units that have recently emphasized the importance of marketing and advertising that respects and supports children's rights in their guidance for how companies should assess their impacts on children's rights.</p>
<p>Facebook says that its statement of rights and responsibilities and data policy contains strong protections against the disclosure of our users personal information, but the so called aggregate the identified data that our company does provide through collaborations with major advertisers, data brokers, developers and mobile services is extraordinarily revealing and allows advertisers to engage in highly targeted marketing, nowhere does the company state if there are special rules governing the sharing of such data about users who are minors.</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p>Further Facebook states that its advisory policy help foster safe environment to connect and share, but the only limits on ads to minors include a few adult products. And the Board does not include any organization that has expertise on the impacts of marketing on children and you. We’re considering that Facebook has not committed to protect young consumers from threats to privacy involving commercial use of personal information, or from harmful advertising given the increasing reliance on users’ data by marketers, the intensive use of social media by young people and use highly perceptibility to marketing messages. Therefore we urge shareholders to vote yes on this proposal and we reiterate our request of the company management to continue this conversation with concerned investors. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Colin Stretch</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Sister and thank you for all the statements, we will now provide responses to these statements as the responses of the company have already been set forth in the proxy statement. I will have over now open up the floor for questions specifically on the proposals. We will have a general Q&amp;A session later but if you have any questions specifically related to the proposals being considered I encourage you to line up at the microphone. If you have a question but can't get to a microphone please raise your hand and one of our volunteers will bring one to you. And as stated in the rules of conduct stockholders should not address the meeting until recognized and after being recognized please identify yourself, identify the proposal your question is directed to and then ask your question kindly please limit on your question to one minute so that we can preserve time for the general Q&amp;A later, sir?</p>
<p id="question-answer-session"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q - Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>My name is Sheldon Hurling I'm a shareholder. I would like to address the last two proposals, first the one from the Controller of the State of the New York. Now remember that the controller of the State of the New York pretends to represent the hundreds of thousands of workers employed by the government of the State it does not. Those workers may have different opinions and remember that a recent Controller of the State of New York was consecutive crimes and sent to prison. On the proposal by the sisters they don't want you to allow McDonald’s to ask the kids to have a burger and fries both know in both these proposals.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Colin Stretch</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, sir. Any other questions or statements in connection with the proposals being considered? So we have a hand there can someone, do you want to make it to a microphone or do you want to?</p><div class="adPlaceHolder"></div>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>My name is Carol Ruth Silver and I speak in favor of the two proposals number 5 and 6 that were represented by Sister Byron, I think that Facebook although it has not adopted a mission statement like Google to do no harm is believed by those of us who use the platform, those of us who believe in the company that it is trying to do no harm and it is very, very clear from reading the local newspapers The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times that American companies are doing great hunt in the third world by permitting the kind of things that is addressed in these proposals. I think that Facebook should look at and should respond to in a more reasoned way, the proposals and that shareholders I hope will vote in substantial numbers to support them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Colin Stretch</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you I do want to make sure the audience is aware that the proxy statement does include very comprehensive responses to the proposals that are before you. With respect to those last three proposals I hate to add that we agree with the importance certainly of human rights and how that connects to our mission. And we certainly agree with providing a product that is safe for all our users including younger users, the question is how best to serve those interests and as reflected in the proxy statement we feel like we have a strong game plan placed with respect to both and that the proposals themselves would not further those interest. Are there any other questions on the proposals themselves?</p>
<p>We will now collect any remaining ballets please raise your ballets and our volunteers will come around to collect them, anyone else, any more two more? Okay. All votes have been cast on the proposals to be considered at this meeting and as of 11:19 the polls are now closed. So I’ll now confirm with the Inspector of Election and shortly w will report on the preliminary results of the voting. Results. So the votes acquired to approve proposal one the Election Director is a polarity of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. Based on the votes as calculated by the Inspector of Election each of the eight nominees on the ballet received the highest number of affirmative votes cast and therefore each of the nominees has been elected to the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The vote acquired to approve proposals two through six is a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy based on results as calculated by the Inspector of Election the proposal to ratify the employment of Ernst &amp; Young LLP Proposal Two and the proposal to reapprove Section 162(m) limits of our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan under the internal revenant code Proposal Three has been approved by at least the requisite majority of the votes cast and each of the stockholder proposals, proposals four through six have been rejected by at least the requisite majority of the votes cast. There are no other formal items of business before the meeting. Final results will be recorded as stated in the minutes of this meeting and filed with the SEC on a Form 8-K within four business days. This concludes the formal part of our meeting and the Annual Meeting is now adjourned.</p>
<p>Now, before I ask Mark to come up on the stage to share some thoughts on the company I want to remind you that Mark’s remark and the Q&amp;A that follow may contain forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. We caution you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, in the presentation and the Q&amp;A to follow. These risk factors are fully detailed under the caption Risk Factors and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 23, 2015. In addition please note that the date of this annual meeting is June 11, 2015 and any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Mark?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Zuckerberg</span></strong></p>
<p>I want to start off by just thanking all you guys for coming out today and for holding our stock and for believing in us. At Facebook we believe that this mission that we're on, to help make the world more open and connected is a really important and meaningful thing for a lots of people around the world. And your confidence in our team and our company in achieving that and importance of that mission is very meaningful and we take that very seriously. So thank you guys all for all the viewers for coming out today.</p>
<p>In terms of this mission, right, we think that this is more important than ever today to help connect people around the world, in a lot of ways the world remains very divided and it is more divided than ever. But services that can help people communicate and stay in touch can help families were reunited and help people stay in touch when they're far away from each other. Helps businesses, small businesses and large amounts of commerce be able to happen it enables people to get connected to people who'd be new customers for them and able to create new things and grow jobs and the economy and it’s shaped how we communicate with our leaders in society and hopefully that helps to shape their worlds for the better as well. So we believe very deeply and in this mission what we're doing and we're really proud of the results over the last year and in 2014 and the momentum that we have for being able to deliver more results going forward.</p>
<p>And when I think about the, the parts of our strategy and what we're trying to do over the next decade. We kind of divided up into three basic time frames. All right there's in over the next few years there are some things that we're doing. We have this big sort of product today, more than 1.4 billion people use the Facebook Web site and app every month and a lot more people we think would benefit from using that and we're working on trying to make that a better experience and trying to grow that and grow the business around that and that's a really big focus. So I am happy to talk about that today.</p>
<p>Over the next three to five years one of the big parts of our story is going to be that Facebook now is no longer just a single app in a way that people communicate but now we've developed a strategy of trying to build multiple world class apps and services for all the different ways that people want to communicate. Right so, we acquired this company WhatsApp. Where now 800 million people use that to send messages, every month across the world and we've built this product messenger that more than 700 million people are using to communicate. We have a group product that more than 700 million people monthly are using to communicate in small groups and share on topics about their interest.</p>
<p>And we have communities like Instagram that more than 300 million people are using to share things, also that their interest in broader groups to often more publicly, so what you're seeing is that there're all these different kinds of products and we're focused on building world class tools in each of these different categories whether it's private communication or sharing with interest based communities or sharing publicly that expands on this mission to give people more ability to share what's important to them. So over the next three or five years a big part of what we do is going to be continuing to grow those communities while also starting to evolve those products to become important drivers of revenue in our overall business as well. That'll be an important and fun part of what we get to do over the next five years.</p>
<p>Over 10 years we look to figure out what are the big changes in the world that we need to help drive in order to really deliver on this mission to make the world more open and connected. So we talk about things like internet.org which is this effort to help spread Internet access around the world because in order for people to be able to communicate, I mean stay in touch with people and enjoy all the economic benefits that the Internet brings they're going to have to be on the Internet and that's not the case today. Actually only a little more than a third of the world's population has Internet access. So we're working on a long-term project to be able to drive more Internet access that more people can share in those benefits than. We're proud that today I think it's more than 9 million people already have Internet access who didn't before because of our efforts through internet.org. So it's still early on in terms of what we're doing there but that's going to be increasingly important thing that we're doing to drive this mission of helping everyone around the world be able to stay connected.</p>
<p>There're other things that we're doing over the long-term as well, we're trying to build future platforms for how people will connect and communicate. So whether that's building virtual reality and augmented reality so that way you know just like there were computers and now people primarily use mobile phones as their way of communicating and using apps, in the future we think that there'll be new computing platforms and we want to be at the forefront of building that here.</p>
<p>So you can kind of look at these different parts of our strategy, three years, taking the community around sharing in Facebook and news feed and continuing to grow that and the business around it. Three to five years taking these new products that we've either built or acquired into our family and continuing to grow those parts of the community and turn them into major contributors for our business as well and over the 10 year time horizon solving these fundamental issues in the world that will really unlock the ability to deliver this mission for everyone in the world, so we're really excited. We have a lot of fun stuff going on that I think is going to drive a lot of value for the world broadly in delivering this mission and for our shareholders and I thank you guys for all of your support a long away.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Colin Stretch</span></strong></p>
<p>So, I’d like to invite Sheryl Sandberg our COO and Dave Wehner our CFO and Joel Kaplan our Vice President of Global Public Policy to join Mark on the stage. I will now open it up for general Q&amp;A. You can see pieces of tape behind each of the microphone, so please line up behind the tape, and I would like to ask Reverend Jackson to honor us with the first question. Reverend Jackson?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Reverend Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much. I'd like to discuss some issues in moment of justice and inclusion but before I deliver I'd like to take a special liberty for all the condolences and consolation to Sheryl.</p>
<p>I would like to say that Sheryl, in 1970, I though the King was killed in 1968, his father said to me that Martin will survive after he survived Mississippi and Chicago, but then he was killed suddenly. All who left him were back home, I used to go to the graveyard alone and talk with him every day. I think he was talking back to me. </p>
<p>And focused so much on him until I forgot I have some others at home and so my son was killed [indiscernible] the morning. If I just direct my wife was starting to feel while I was in church and she was playing the organ. The message was that I lost a lot in Martin, who had lot left that I had forgotten. You have lost a lot, you should have a lot left.</p>
<p>For those who know the worth of prayer, I wish you would join hands and bow heads in prayer for I might make that appeal.</p>
<p>We [indiscernible] all of our way to acknowledge God, that we may be alone to God who has promised to never leave us alone. We ask God to be with Sheryl and her children in a special way, and to let her in this time of inner pain. You would release and surpasses understanding. The mystery of death came suddenly. Eclipse the sun, but behind the darkness the sun never stops shining. She has lost a lot, but has a lot left. Precious memories, two darling children, a legacy, and they will live as long as they remember him and we will never forget. Amen.</p>
<p>Thank you. Mark, shareholder board, the members, and the shareholders. I thank you for the opportunity to present to you today. This financial year Rainbow/PUSH lots of campaigns to disrupt to take industry to the difference that you have made, over 25 companies released their data, diversity data. What I would call 2% problem. Today racial diversity and inclusion, incommon equality are at the full front of the industry's agenda. Women and people with color represented unnecessary market, unutilized talent and uncapped capital. Diversity and inclusion was to drive innovation in this next era and Facebook and tech industry will do well to embrace and engaged and empower this base of creative innovation. Eventually it is across the industry who will disrupt the industry with a vision, commitment and encourage to have usher a new area of diversity and inclusion. Facebook is a young company but not too young to step up and lead this new era. Despite your best efforts the representation of African Americans and Latinos remain basically static. Too many technology companies have zero or too few women in color on their boards. </p>
<p>The standard thing [indiscernible] think bold. Put your mind so as you can certainly build a pipeline to women, African Americans and Latinos and people of color to change the face of technology. The good news is that Facebook has had policy to pay minimum wage of $15 an hour. Negotiating and ongoing contract was robust or adverse. Tim Cook said this week diversity and inclusion are solvable if taken to surely consult the most challenging complex problems in the world. </p>
<p>I want to pose a few questions Mark if I may. Where are we a year later? Facebook released -- you wanted to pull diversity data this year. What progress have you made in closing. How many new employees has Facebook hired this year? How many and what percentage of the black, Latino, Asian and women? The Facebook problem with Rainbow/PUSH, we've given a thousand churches across the country to put tech labs in their churches to train amateurs, financially literacy and the stock market gain, they your support. Don Graham has left your board -- Facebook made commitment to replace him with an African American or a person of color. And you are agreed to place a ballot amendment that will imply on exclusive and active search for women. People of color for all future board openings. </p>
<p>We have people who are qualified right now, hope the board does not shrink. There are few people at the bottom who are colored, the whites come back to as snow capped mountain. We must make the board look like America. Facebook considered tax reforming to repay trade to over 2 trillion and also the profits to reinvest and rebuild America. Lastly can you speak to Facebook's multicultural advertising marketing strategists and utilization of American legal professional and international services for new companies. Thank you again for allowing me to share with you today. Well you agree with me or not, like me Jesse L Jackson on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sheryl Sandberg</span></strong></p>
<p>Reverend Jackson let me start thanking you deeply for your personnel thoughts and prayers. I know that I am not the only person who faced grief you shared your story and you have served so many people here and also have Facebook as al and your prayers bring us all together in hope and hope and I know I am grateful and I imagine everyone else here a thank you I appreciate it.</p>
<p>So well this is a topic that's very near to dear to our hearts on diversity and we believe it's important not just because it's the right thing to do, avoided, the right thing to do, but also because we believe real deals are better, stronger and more successful companies, if we are represented by the people who represent our product for a very -- we have a unbelievably diverse consumer based 1.4 billion people using our products around the world and that means to we're going to build the best product is by reflecting that type of diversity. And we talk about that cognitive diversity, diversity of thoughts, and a best way to get there is diversify of background that means everything from gender to race also global diversity for us.</p>
<p>Most of our users are outside the United States historically most of our employees we have to really think about how we get reps global, global impact represented. And so we've taken it very seriously we're going to release our numbers. We'll release them the same time we did last year which is towards the end of June. We have had a slightly more progress in actually recruiting people in this year but they don't know the overall numbers as much as we would want and we know we have a long way to go. So the real question you have is what are we doing to move those numbers and here that we're doing, the first thing as we focused on our internal programs to make sure that we are a fair type to work. We treat everyone well. You've mentioned what we do with our contractors and putting in a $15 minimum wage, we're also putting a minimum of 16 paid days off for separate family leave or personal vacations as well as a $4,000 new child benefit so that any to take paid paternal and paid paternity or maternity leave. We are very proud of that and we think that, that will be helpful and we appreciate your support of that.</p>
<p>We also look at the Facebook employee base for many years we've done annual and biannual salary reviews to make sure that we're paying people fairly across things like race and gender. This past year we went one step further and we put in place a very comprehensive managing bias training program, a number of our I would count myself ahead of people at HR where goal is here maxing -- we all worked on this ourselves and we not put a good percentage of company good and it's pretty hard hitting training where we talk about what are the biases both the small things and the bad things and now that I think about it one of the slides have quoted from you in our training, you were part of that training session. We also what you…</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Reverend Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Not royalties?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sheryl Sandberg</span></strong></p>
<p>I am sorry, not royalties. It's a public vote we will work it out, but it's a good quote and it's a hard hitting quote and voices like yours we worked experts on this training around people who could really help us, make sure that we have a kind of environment people would raise issues. We're also working on hard on the pipeline so we did a very big question about recruiting organization the first step to hiring people is getting our recruiting organization and all of us to find the people. We know that they are we're working with the historically that colleges and Hispanic serving institutions to find the candidates that we know are out there so that we get a chance to interview them and hopefully hire them.</p>
<p>We're working on the pipeline. We have a Facebook internship program which was for computer science. We now started a business one and we went number, we started freshmen year because that gives us better than what we have done before that give us a chance to find women and people of diverse backgrounds who might not think they could go to technology company or might not a part of that. By senior year people are a little bit on career path and we went younger to make a bigger investment in starting freshmen year and we went even further that that for our local community with Facebook Academy setting up an internship program for local high school students so they could get involved.</p>
<p>We have also done a bunch of trying to increase diversity in computer science because that is so important to our industry and it's something you have spoken to so many companies on in partnership with the Lean In Foundation and we need a board foundation. We set up computer science and engineering circles on campuses. Men, women anyone can join to try to get people interest in computer science to stay, our goal is to have 100 of those circles and are 200 and we just launched and one of those now has become the lean intern program. There is a college student of men from Tunisia and a woman from the United States got together and formed a group of 200 interns in the valley at 85 companies that are leaning in together and we're supporting that. We also work with Craig Hopper and a bunch of programs.</p>
<p>We know we're not where we need to be. We know we need to change our numbers that we can reflect the diversity of population we serve and we’re committed to all of these programs a lot of this is new and doing even more going forward we’re also grateful for the opportunity to work with you and other grassroots organizations.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Reverend Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>May I just say that it's not numbers for numbers sake, our support get a each one of the workers, we have workers potentially in Auckland, and San Jose and LA, and Memphis and Chicago we must train our own youth and even the play in field. Secondly the Board does not look like Facebook space and with the absence of Mr. Brand here is outstanding opportunity for you to at least to consider expand that Board, because I think was missing in that quote it was play is a great, great, great, great quarter back and as the all the skills or has one is best is they can miss half of the plan for you. And so when you missed the plan field you miss many opportunity to score and survive and what makes our football players great that makes team great there is the plan to believe the rules of profit goals are clear requisite affair and the score is transparent our appeal on your Boards and on your, associates and in your investment please consider our appeal for a goal target plan more inclusive as the key to growth. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Good morning Board of Directors. My name is Chris Board a shareholder and most importantly an enthusiastic user of Facebook. So thank you. My question this morning is with regards to the desirability of using Facebook. I am curious to learn of what instruments or tests either internal or external that is not only reconfirming the usability of Facebook but also the desirability for end-users and this seems to be increasingly important and increasingly populated field of social media options? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Zuckerberg</span></strong></p>
<p>When you talk about Facebook, I think most people today still think about their experience of reading news feeds right that’s 1.4 billion people every month open up the Facebook app or Web site and they are primary experience is seem just kind of content. And we -- [indiscernible] optimizing that. The average person has 150 friends or more on Facebook and those people are sharing a bunch of content each day and our job is to make sure that we can show you the most important things that you don't want to miss. So if your cousin has a baby or someone post something that’s really important going on in the world then there might be hundreds of different posts that you could see that day and one of the things that we think is really critical to our job is making sure that those most of the important things are showing really prominently at the top and our surface. We know that we need to make sure that the service is really fast, right it takes 5 seconds or 10 seconds to load app then if that’s a worse experience and people aren't going to want to use that as much.</p>
<p>So there are all these different metrics that we’re tracking very closely and every change that we make from how quickly the upload, how quickly can people navigate through it, how people rank the content what we’re showing, are the people engaged with it as they create more connection between people, are people commenting and they are sending messages those the content that were showing encourage the people to interact more with their friends or less and a big part of how we run the company is we empower all the engineers and product managers and designers to try on new idea so makes this better but after each idea that we try out we look very rigorously that how would affect each of those different things that we care about then we just move forward to the ones that are really positive for the community.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Colin Stretch</span></strong></p>
<p>I should have said at the out that thank you for your question sir. I should have -- as said at the outset we’re going to ask everyone to limit themselves to one question for one minute because we have so many of you here and we’re grateful but we would like to get to as many questions as we can, sir?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I am Chad Rou from Dallas. And at my age it help me to picking analogies and it seems to me that people used to find that occupy real estate and there might be something that I call digital real estate where Facebook is clearly taking the high ground. Is that fair to think of the face of your mobile app is a digital real estate store and that it's there to defend? And then the other thing another part of the same question on analogy, Brian Nelson won 11 titles in 1946 and then quit because he said he has a try to try the fire is still burning is it not? That’s for you sir.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Zuckerberg</span></strong></p>
<p>I don't know if I understood the second part of what you are asking.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Well we've had something success and is the fire still there? You have to try to try.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Zuckerberg</span></strong></p>
<p>So you asked two different questions and I can take both of them. So the first one around the real estate and one of the things that we think about this is connected to the first question as well is the better of a job we can do at showing people contents that is important to them then they will also engage more, right. So instead of maybe only reading through or looking at 20 stories just make these numbers in actually how much look it, maybe they’ll look at 25 that we can do a better job of ranking and passing the important stuff across the network. The real numbers are closer about 100.</p>
<p>So as 100s is on and when you are talking about real estate the better of the job we can do at showing content and the more we earn that people are going to look at more content in Facebook and those pieces of content I think are the real state that’s important because bit of the more time and more engagement that people spending for the business then they’ll also more ads and engaging those ads and we’ll make money in addition to helping people connect more with their friends and know more about what’s going on in the world. So as we improve the experience we do increase the amount of real estate and that I think is aligned with this mission of connecting people around the world and in growing our business. For your second question about, are we still excited to keep pushing hard? </p>
<p>Yes, I think one of things that awesome about where we are now is that we can take on much bigger project. So instead of just growing one weekly which is our Facebook in new speed is today we can grow multiple communities at the same time with all the lessons that we’ve learned -- going its first community over the past 10 years. So I mentioned this in my opening comments but WhatsApp now has more than 800 million people using it. When they joined us they had little more than 400 million. Messenger we grew it housed from nothing to now more than 700 million people using it.</p>
<p>Instagram joined us when I think they had 20 million or 30 million people and now more than 300 million people using it and groups again we’ve grown from scratch from nothing to more than 700 million a month using it and part of it allows us to do this, we’ve built up these lessons and each of experience from growing the core Facebook product that we can now take on multiple bigger projects at the same time I think those things will also contribute to the mission of the company helping people connect and share in different ways and also be big businesses in our revenue lines for our business and our own rights overtime. So I’m really excited this is a very exciting time.</p>
<p>Being able to take on projects also beyond that like internet.org not only to connect people on the Internet but be able to grow the Internet and grow the opportunity that the Internet brings around the world and those are awesome things. You kind of still get to take on until you already have this base that you can build from and a lot of time the people of the company you can solve the different kinds of problems like that. So I’d say that we’re more motivated than ever to take on bigger problems for the world.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. My name is Charles Long coming from New York City. Thanks again for hosting this meeting. So despite what the media says like my financial analysis shows that Facebook stock is still very undervalue. So my question revolves around, what’s the rationale for using Facebook stock for acquisitions versus using cash, which would be a lot cheaper for us?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dave Wehner</span></strong></p>
<p>I can take that, we obviously value being a shareholder and thank you, we believe we’ve got great opportunities to continue to invest to grow this business going forward. So we will continue to evaluate what forms and consideration we use to grow the business going forward and the most important thing is that we believe we’ve got great opportunities to invest across the different dimensions that Mark talked about. So the near term continuing to grow the advertising business. We’ve got great opportunity to continue to make that more effective for both our users and our advertisers and then in the longer term we’ve got great opportunities around these next generation of services that Mark talked about. So I think the thing that we’re more excited about is the opportunity continues to invest to grow this business and we’ll obviously look at what forms of consideration we use for acquisition on an ongoing basis and make out a valuation but thank you for your question and being a shareholder.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>But how you decide when you used stock versus cash?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dave Wehner</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we’ll look at that time based on the valuation of what the acquisition involves. As we look at the acquisitions we did last year for instance for WhatsApp despite that acquisition made it necessary that we’ll use a large stock components given our cash balances. So we look at it on the basis on what we think is the right and prudent strategy for the company both financially and operationally.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m [indiscernible] shareholder, I’m very happy since late 2012 when the [indiscernible]. First few seconds for Sheryl [indiscernible] comparison with the opportunities to say that Mark, what cost and services are you not working on and you wish you can right now given that you are having a position to do something that other companies connecting billions of people, what can you do beyond global advertising?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sheryl Sandberg</span></strong></p>
<p>So I think it's a hard question to answer because the things we're not working on are things we might want to work on and then like other people might work on them if we say we're not working on them. So if you don't mind, with your permission as a shareholder with your best interest at heart I'm going to just take the present to talk a little bit about what the future looks like in mobile advertising because we have a lot of opportunities to invest there as well. And then we promised we will continue to invest in more things and unveil those as we can go public if that's okay with you.</p>
<p>So when we think about mobile advertising if you look back just a couple of years, we didn't have mobile ads, and we sit today in I think a much better position than we even would have hoped which is I think we have by far the best mobile ads product on the market. We have a tremendous amount of user time and attention on mobile if we get in U.S. as a proxy one in seven minutes on the desktop, we get one in five minutes Facebook and then some more for Instagram on a mobile front. And that's amazing because it shows you how deep the engagement is.</p>
<p>What people do more than anything else on Facebook with that mobile time is that they run the newsfeed? And I think our team or ads team our engineers are certainly to be congratulated for building a product that fits so well into news feed and being able to sell high quality apps that people engage. That's it but it is a lot more recent too, if you ask yourself what percentage of the ads you see on Facebook are really-really good for you, as interesting to you as your organic content, their variability right, we all know some people post more interesting content than others, there're some posts that are great and there are some posts that aren't as interesting, that's true of our ads as well. But with our ads I think we have a really big opportunity to continue to make them more targeted for you, more personal and opportunities to be something you really want.</p>
<p>We also had an opportunity to grow our advertiser base and when we grow our advertiser base around the world we have an opportunity to offer better ads. What's 2 million advertising, that's largely small businesses and one thing we're really excited about is sheer question of having an opportunity to do it. We've had huge numbers post a video to Facebook. If you ask yourself how many small businesses have been able to shoot a video ad and put it on TV it's prohibitively expensive, but can you post a video to Facebook to your page yes. And so we have an opportunity to give the kinds of tools that only big companies have, not just the big companies, we do that to, but the small companies around the world enable you to connect with things you might otherwise not find and I think that is a lot of things you have an opportunity to invest in mobile ads.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dave Wehner</span></strong></p>
<p>One thing that I was just going to add to that, I think that that's the right answer on the business side. In terms of product and engagement, one thing that I'm really excited that we started working on it recently but I think we should be doing more around are enabling people in our community to help each other. It's something that you know people really want to do deeply, but you know they're not necessarily day to day things like posting a photo. I can give you few examples. So there was just this big earthquake in Nepal right and you know one of the things that we did was we built this safety check product. So that way everyone who was in the proximity of the earthquake we notified them and asked them to say if they was safe. And if they were safe and they marked themselves as safe then all of their friends found out about that.</p>
<p>I mean if you've ever had a close friend or family member in a disaster all you want to know is that they're safe right, and no other products or community in the world had the reach or ability to build something like that so easily and you know for the first 10 years of the company we had to really focus very hard on just making the news feed work, make messaging work, stuff like that but now I think we can also help build tools for the community to help each other in ways like that. And I think it was, do you remember the number of people who marked themselves as safe. It was something like, it was millions, millions, and more than a 100 million people got notified that, that somebody that they cared about was safe. We also built a tool that made it so that our community could pull together to raise money for the victims and we enabled our community to raise more than $15 million in aids. Right for – to help the recovery after Nepal which is bigger than most governments around the world contributed to help that out. I can give other examples. There are…</p>
<p>I'm really excited about the stuff too. We had a, you know a small team and you guys were really involved in us built brought AMBER alerts to Facebook right. So that way when young children are abducted or missing in an area, we could show a story and a picture of that child at the top of news feed and we can show that in a more targeted way because we know the people in our community, where they live and if someone or if they're in the likely place where the child was abducted might be and we've already found at least one case where a child was saved because someone saw an AMBER alert on Facebook and then realized that they'd seen the child around them and then reported it to the police and brought the child home. So there's a lot more stuff like that that we can do and I think we're in a unique position to do this and I think that there's a real hunger from our community to want to help each other and this is part of making the world more open and connected. We want to do that and that's something that I think going forward we're going to be able to do and I'm really excited about and proud that we can play hard.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, Safety Check exactly what I want to say I hope there is lot more services like that, and you built up trust with the whole world it is important and Sheryl, Facebook had we're very happy customers, we have multiple venture capital investments we've made, video ads is obviously amazing ROIs and we're getting tens of thousands of users around the world at very low price point side from we're excited on both front.

<p>Hi, Mr. Zuckerberg and Board. My name is Kelvin Yurt and I'm a shareholder and engineer and educator. And I think some of the comments, you have already made covered some of the questions I had. But essentially, at the Twitter meeting, they had announced that they're allowing universities access to their data to conduct research, for example to study the propagation of the flood through Tweets rather than their traditional means through their clinical studies. Now, can you comment on any specific activities or studies that Facebook is supporting both internally and externally with its big data to universities in the areas of science and research?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sheryl Sandberg</span></strong></p>
<p>So we care a lot about contributing to the knowledge base of the world and we have research projects and time that we've purchased on things, so when I can see above that we get it. One of the things, we looked at overtime was the counterfeit filter level. You just being on Facebook, makes you more inclined to have the same political views or different political views are you fighting on Facebook, just exposing yourself to the same views that the world get more follower on. What we found was that that’s not true. That was Facebook does, it's actually strengthen but reception is how do utilized, so your son dies -- it's actually for your [indiscernible]. Facebook doesn't really change your relationship with those people, I talk to my mom and I talk to my sister, right? So what Facebook does do is strengthening your [indiscernible] with also to furnish some color that would not be able to keep upgrade or my friends from growing up in Miami, my friends from previous jobs or previous schools I attended, and because of that, those group actually tend to have more broad view and people, I have time or energy to act with every day. So, I work in Facebook now on a same basis, I know, that's with my family, my close friends and my Facebook colleagues. Because of Facebook is a product, I can interact with people at all the companies, I used to work out with -- and so it actually broadened my views. So there are times to broad exposure I have, so there is time and we definitely do, research project with very careful with user data when we do it and we'll continue to share those learnings with the world.</p>

<p>Hi, everyone. My name is Debra and a individual shareholder since IPO. I believe currently Facebook is now a dividend paying company, so I was wondering, would Facebook be consider paying dividend to its shareholder in the future?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Zuckerberg</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you again for your question and thanks for being a shareholder with us from the IPO that's great here. When we think about our capital allocation process that something whether, we take extremely seriously and we spend a lot of time considering again, I think the focus for us today is on growth and the opportunities that we have to grow with different things that we've talked about today. So the near term growing the business around Facebook and we ads businesses tons of investment opportunities we have there in the longer term around the other new services that we built out and the other applications that we have and then longer term beyond that, we've got things like investing in the next platform and the VR opportunity. So there is so much that we have to do to grow the business and so many opportunities there, that's our focus from a capital allocation perspective and so that's we're going to be investing in most of our dollars.</p>

<p>Good morning. Michael Cutner from Philadelphia, a shareholder, first -- thank you very much for your original idea, many years ago and the inspiration of leadership that you had in creating the company that we're here today talking about. A few things, first, I've attended a lot of annual shareholder meetings and to me the more time shareholders get actually see the executives leading the company first and the more likely you're do to attract the kind of investors that are most aligned with your goals and vision for the company. So I would encourage, will you keep doing these meeting and extending the time actually, the request would be extent to time as long as possible but when you said 12:10 I got a little bit nervous that I wouldn't even be able to get an answer to the question. I think I was one of like ape in mind. So please if you could think about extending, extending the time you will have for Q&amp;A. So the question I had was about the regulatory environment and it seems like legislators are often not the experts in the industry that they pass legislation on and food, pharma, financial industries they all seem to trip themselves up by sometimes acting in ways that in their own best interest even 70 years after the financial industry has some of the first regulations passed they can’t seem to avoid a juicy scandal every now and then at promising legislation that side in best interest, so first question on that is, first how do you view the regulatory environment and the role of legislators and what they know they probably have Facebook accounts? And second what kind of steps you pick to help educate and inform legislators about social policies that could impact the Company?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dave Wehner</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks I'll take that one. First of all thanks for your first comment, one of the things that we've done provide more opportunity for people ask questions and hear from leadership as Mark then doing in frequent Q&amp;As in addition to the annual shareholder meeting, that's another great opportunity for him to share his vision for the Company and to people hear that. On the regulatory environment that how we address it, we have increasingly robust global public policy team around the world because as global company we one point 4 billion users, people use our service around the globe.</p>
<p>We do have governments around the world who are very interested in how our service affects their constituents and how it helps them communicate with their constituents and their citizens and that's something that we're very proud of. So what we try to do is be really responsive to the concerns that we know those policies makers and regulators have. We want to make sure we're answering that question because as it says sometimes it may just be a function of them not fully understanding the product and our job is to go in and show them our service and show them the value is contributing to the world and how it's helping their constituents connect with the things and the people they care about.</p>
<p>We find that when we have policy makers who are more informed and more educated they're likely to make better judgments and better decisions about the rules they put in place that affects our industry and our service. And one of the things that were we particularly focused on is we want to make sure they understand the economic contribution that Facebook is making and helping create jobs and drive innovation. And so we walk them through some of those contributions as well and we found that the more people understand our service the better they'll be at making laws at the governor sector.</p>

<p>Hi, I am Melanie Newkirk from Los Angeles, California. You know this meeting is very staid, at Berkshire Hathaway stockholders we had a lot of fun, but this is so staid. Whatever, this, that, bah, bah, I wish you would improve that Mark you know. And so doing and I am sure [indiscernible] my sympathies too, we were at Berkshire at this time when this happened [indiscernible]. Know that I'm a practitioner at the Agape International Spiritual Center in LA so our personal review definitely. What I wanted. I saw something on TV the other day on the alternative school in San Francisco that they just started from Google, former Google employees started. And they're doing programming and looking at the things that young people do in order to study. I thought that Facebook would be good to start an in your face school.</p>
<p>Get it, in your face, Facebook school even if it's cartoons or something or people answering questions in your face young people. I have a niece that is going to school online and took the wrong courses at the end and can't really learn and I looked at Khan Academy and what they're doing, I think that Facebook can come up with a in your face thing that young people can relate to, to study to know that it's worth studying. It's worth being in your face so that they can understand that. Now you can give me a quote on there in your face but I think it would be a wonderful thing and it would be a fun thing too. To start this sort of, even in a cartoon form. I think that Warren Buffet we have some children's books and the children learn about finance, and what have you know of that sort of thing. So they can learn to learn through Facebook because they're on it all the time. So if would take that into consideration Sheryl please along with these other things you've mentioned your academies and other things that you deal with. But in your face, you could market that. Give it to you for free.</p>

<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi I'm Kevin, no pressure on this one I guess. So each year Facebook becomes more and more relevant in our life. 10 years it was mainly for writing on walls and updating people on what you are doing as long as that started with an is. And today we share photos and videos post stories and learn seven secret new drinks you can order at Starbucks. Anyway when things happen we post it online instead of texting we use the messenger app we use group discussions ideas and I used this find out my coworkers are single but essentially where is Facebook headed in terms of further integrating into our day-to-day lives?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>It's a great question, and I think this is really good in the heart of the strategy that we’re pursuing. You can think about all of the different ways that people want to connect and share and I think that there are two primary dimensions that we consider. One is the audience that they are communicating with, so those range from very private like a one-on-one message thread to a small group to a bunch of your friends that won through large interest based community is coming up fully public and there are going to different product at each point along that spectrum of public a person wants to be. And then there are different types of media ranging from very basic text to richer forms of media that include photos or increasingly rich include video more and more in the time and then into the future I think are going to becoming increasingly immersive and that we try to part of our interest and these fully immersive media types like virtual reality and augmented reality then you have seen progressing over time where five years ago most of the post on Facebook were texts and today most of the posts are images, and I think five years from now probably most of the content will be video and then able to continue to getting richer and richer and also diversifying the other content type don’t go away.</p>
<p>So our job is to be the best at giving people the tools that they need to share something at each point on that spectrum. So if you want to share photo with your wife then go for it, right and that’s going to require one kind of product, if you want to share videos publically then that’s the different kind of thing, if you share used links with friends or an interest community then that’s a different kind of thing, and we just want to make sure that we are serving our whole community across the world more than billion people at this point with world class ways to communicate in all the different ways that they want and increasingly that means not just building everything into a single product but also building different products because sometimes things like messaging require the whole app to be dedicated to private communication in order to deliver that world class experience which we’re committed doing. So I think you will see more of that in terms of the different audiences and types of content that’s just a continue aiming to be the best way that people have to share any type of content that’s important to them with any set of people that’s important to them. And over the next few years that’s going to be our goal.</p>

<p>And with Reverends Jackson’s support so I just want to say I'm a retired nurse from San Francisco so I thank you Mark for that and Sheryl I was very touched by the essay you wrote and oddly I didn't know you wrote it when I read it so that was really very touched. But anyway this addresses proposal number three from the proxy and also some of the doctor Jackson or Reverends Jackson’s comments that I can't go to speak at General Electric and ExxonMobil but I can't speak at Facebook because I am a shareholder and this mainly goes to the CFO and proposal number three was some sort of we are going to keep this in line so that we can get more corporate tax deduction and Reverends Jackson spoke about repatriating some of the profits that the CFO and the [indiscernible] of people from Ernst the accountants to lawyers try to get the corporation not to pay and feel that as a citizen of this country that the infrastructure is falling apart we could be the good guys and maybe my stock will go down $0.02 a share but I don't care I would rather support the American people, the American country and I think Facebook can do the right thing and be the good guy.</p>

We are a tax payor of course, and we’re tax rate in 2015 as a 45% tax rate on a GAAP basis, so we are a large tax payor and we believe that we should be contributing into the community in which we operate in that go through contributing our service and through paying the taxes that we should. So thank you for your comment.</p>
